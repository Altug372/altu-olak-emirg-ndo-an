                <p>Women in STEM have so far made very modest and insufficient progress. It is time to capitalize on the technological revolution and move our societies forward together, leaving no one behind. The world must take more initiative and commitment to achieve gender equality goals.
                    While groups like "Girls Who Code" and "GEG" are doing groundbreaking work, these programs alone cannot change the world. For a sustainable, inclusive and future-ready economy, we must promote gender equality in business, government, legislation and culture. It is important to recognize that achieving gender equality is not only a matter of justice, but also brings significant economic benefits.
                    <br><br>
                    To ensure this:
                    <br>
                    Education and Talent Development: STEM education programs should be established for women to develop themselves in STEM fields. These programs can help women develop their leadership abilities and STEM skills.
                    <br><br>
                    Flexible Working Models: Flexible working models should be created to help women balance STEM careers with family responsibilities. In addition, childcare and nursery services should be provided in workplaces.
